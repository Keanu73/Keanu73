## Greetings! 👋
Greetings to thee, fellow brethel! I am known by the name of Keanu (believe it or not), and I'm a budding young developer who has a deep passion for open-source projects. If you want to contact me for whatever reason, ping me at [keanu@keanu73.net](mailto:keanu@keanu73.net), and you can always leave a cheeky comment on my [website](https://keanu73.net) as many others have done... 🤭
